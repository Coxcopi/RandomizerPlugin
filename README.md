# RandomizerPlugin
Randomizer is a Minecraft Plugin that gives players a random item or block every 15 seconds.
### Version
Randomizer is built for Bukkit/Spigot Minecraft servers running version 1.19.2 (latest stable version).
### Usage
Randomizer currently offers two commands for starting and stopping the timer.

**/randomizer start** - Starts the 15 second timer.

**/randomizer stop** - Stops the timer (Players no longer recieve items).

### Installation
Download the latest .jar file (either from Github releases or from the Bukkit Page) and put it in you plugins directory. Restart your server.

**Note: The plugin should be compatible with any other plugins. If you do experience any issues, make sure to open an Issue on Github or write a comment on the Bukkit page.**

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] Add command for adjusting the delay of the Timer.
